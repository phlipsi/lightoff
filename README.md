Light off
=========

This is a game for the Game Boy written during the Global Game Jam 2022.
Summary from Global Game Jam project page:

> Our hero is trapped in a miraculous world with a dual reality. One is a nice
> and warm summer day in mushroom land. The other one is a dark and dank
> basement. A seemingly innocent eye grants him the power to switch between
> these dual realities. And he sorely needs this ability in order to get his
> beloved key back.
